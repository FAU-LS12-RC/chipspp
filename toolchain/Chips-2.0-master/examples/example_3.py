Implement Quicksort
===================

This example sorts an array of data using the 
`Quick Sort algorithm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort>`_

The quick-sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm, but *Chips* does not
support recursive functions. Since the level of recursion is bounded, it is
possible to implement the function using an explicitly created stack.

.. code-block:: c

    %s

The algorithm is tested using an array containing out of order values. The program correctly sorts the array::
