Physical Interface
==================

`Input`, `Output` and `Wire` objects within a chip are implemented using a
synchronous interconnect bus. The details of the interconnect bus are described
here. This section will be of most use to developers who want to integrate a
*Chips* design into a larger design, or to generate an HDL wrapper to support a
*Chips* design in new hardware.

Interconnect Bus Transaction
----------------------------
 
1. Both transmitter and receiver **shall** be synchronised to the 0 to 1 transition of `clk`.
#. If `rst` is set to 1, upon the 0 to 1 transition of `clk` the transmitter **shall** terminate any active bus transaction and set `<bus_name>_stb` to 0.
#. If `rst` is set to 1, upon the 0 to 1 transition of `clk` the receiver **shall** terminate any active bus transaction and set `<bus_name>_ack` to 0.
#. If `rst` is set to 0, normal operation **shall** commence.
#. The transmitter **may** insert wait states on the bus by setting `<bus_name>_stb` to 0.
#. The transmitter **shall** set `<bus_name>_stb` to 1 to signify that data is valid.
#. Once `<bus_name>_stb` has been set to 1, it **shall** remain at 1 until the transaction completes.
#. The transmitter **shall** ensure that `<bus_name>` contains valid data for the entire period that `<bus_name>_stb` is 1.
#. The transmitter **may** set `<bus_name>` to any value when `<bus_name>_stb` is 0.
#. The receiver **may** insert wait states on the bus by setting `<bus_name>_ack` to 0.
#. The receiver **shall** set `<bus_name>_ack` to 1 to signify that it is ready to receive data.
#. Once `<bus_name>_ack` has been set to 1, it **shall** remain at 1 until the transaction completes.
#. Whenever `<bus_name>_stb` is 1 and `<bus_name>_ack` are 1, a bus transaction **shall** complete on the following 0 to 1 transition of `clk`.
#. Both the transmitter and receiver **may** commence a new transaction without inserting any wait states.
#. The receiver **may** delay a transaction by inserting wait states until the transmitter indicates that data is available.
#. The transmitter **shall** not delay a transaction by inserting wait states until the receiver is ready to accept data. Deadlock would occur if both the transmitter and receiver delayed a transaction until the other was ready.
