Installation
====================
Chips++ can be run from the source directory but a few build steps are required.
First, set up all dependencies by calling
```bash
$ source setenv.sh
```
in the root folder.
Note that this will download dependencies when first run, among them LLVM.

```bash
$ ./create_local_install.sh
```
